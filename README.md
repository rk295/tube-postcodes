# London Tube Station postcodes

A while ago (2004!) I needed a list of Tube and DLR station postcodes but couldnâ€™t find one anywhere. I ended up having to screen scrape a couple of sites to produce the list here.

I originally blogged about this [here](http://usefulthings.org.uk/2004/04/london-tube-station-postcodes/), but a few times over the years I've broken the link to the file so I figured I'd put it up on Github.

Thanks to the following for contributing missing postcodes or correcting typos:

* Paul Berry who commented on this post with a postcode for Heron Quays.
* Tony Reynolds who correct Devons Row to Road and added a few DLR stations.

Feel free to do as you wish with this file, it is all public information.

I'm at robin@kearney.co.uk if you have any questions.
